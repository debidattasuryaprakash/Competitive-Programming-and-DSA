### Why companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google focuses on Data Structures and Algorithms

If you’re preparing for a tech interview of any big tech company like Adobe, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc. – most probably, you would have known about the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms to crack these interviews. Yes, most of the interviews for technical roles in these companies are focused on measuring the **Data Structures and Algorithms** knowledge of the candidates.

There are multiple reasons why **Product Based Companies** place so much emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms as stated below:

1. Data Structures and Algorithms demonstrate the **problem-solving ability** of a candidate. There is no room to craft elaborate stories and this means that either the candidate can solve the problem or they can’t.
2. Questions based on Data Structures and Algorithms can be **scaled up or down** according to the knowledge level of the candidate. This means that a variety of candidates can be tested using roughly the same problems.
3. Data Structures and Algorithms are used to test the **analytical skills** of the candidates as they are a useful tool to pick out the underlying algorithms in real-world problems and solve them efficiently.
4. Data Structures and Algorithms are the **fundamentals** of Software Development. They remain the same no matter what new technology is used and that puts the focus on the problem rather than the technology in the interview process.
5. Its Fun.
